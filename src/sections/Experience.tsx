            Diabsenin is a modern attendance application designed for students,
            available on both mobile and web platforms. The mobile app is
            specifically developed for students to easily submit their daily
            attendance, making the process more efficient and accessible. In
            addition to attendance as its core feature, the application includes
            several supporting functions such as an announcement section, where
            students can receive real-time updates and important school
            information. It also features an integrated map to help
            studentsâ€”especially new onesâ€”navigate to their school location,
            making it particularly useful for those unfamiliar with the area.
            Another notable feature is the student ranking system, which serves
            as a form of recognition for students who consistently maintain good
            attendance. On the other hand, the web-based version is designed for
            school administrators and staff, allowing them to manage student
            data effectively. This includes the ability to register students,
            import and export data in bulk, publish announcements, and generate
            attendance reports in PDF format. The platform provides a
            centralized and organized system for handling administrative tasks
            related to student presence and school communication. In the future,
            Diabsenin is planned to be integrated with IoT technology to enable
            automated attendance tracking through smart devices, further
            streamlining the process and enhancing accuracy. As an all-in-one
            solution, Diabsenin not only improves attendance management but also
            strengthens the connection between students and school
            administration through real-time information sharing and digital
            convenience.

            architecture similar to a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, where
            a single application can support multiple organizational units or
            departments as independent tenants. This structure allows for

            autonomy for each unit. The platform enhances efficiency in handling
            various administrative processes related to staffing, making it

            development programs in a digital, organized, and scalable way.

            Neqat is a student attendance application available on both mobile
            and web platforms. The mobile application is specifically designed
            for students to easily record their attendance, serving as the core
            feature of the system. In addition to attendance tracking, the app
            offers several supporting features such as announcements, which keep
            students informed with the latest school updates. It also includes a
            built-in map feature to help guide students to their school
            locationâ€”particularly useful for new students who may be unfamiliar
            with the area, as the map is centered on each respective school&#39;s
            location. On the administrative side, the web application enables
            school staff and administrators to efficiently manage student data.
            This includes functionalities such as student registration, data
            import and export, announcement creation, and more. Neqat provides a
            practical and centralized solution for schools to streamline
            attendance tracking and internal communication in a modern,
            accessible way.

            Sipajonga Buton Tengah is a taxation management application
            developed for the Buton Tengah region. My responsibilities on this
            project included resolving application bugs and developing new
            features to support effective tax data management. One of the key
            contributions was building a payment feature that enables users to
            pay their taxes online, providing a smoother and more efficient
            experience for taxpayers. All development and collaboration tasks
            were carried out within a GitHub-based workflow, ensuring a
            structured, trackable, and team-oriented development process.
